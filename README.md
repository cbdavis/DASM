This is the collection of R Tutorials for the [Data Analysis and Statistical Methods (DASM) WMEE14000](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/rug/vak/show?code=WMEE14000) course at the University of Groningen 

# 2017

* [Practical 1](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical1.html) - into to basic R functions, vectors, sequences, matrices and data frames.  
* [Practical 2](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical2.html) - plotting with ggplot2, loading CSV files, using dplyr for data frame operations.
  * For this practical you will need to download the   [UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbdavis/DASM/master/data/UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv) to your computer.
* (more forthcoming)
