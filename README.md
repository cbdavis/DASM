This is the collection of R Tutorials for the [Data Analysis and Statistical Methods (DASM) WMEE14000](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/rug/vak/show?code=WMEE14000) course at the University of Groningen 

# 2017

* [Practical 1](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical1.html) - into to basic R functions, vectors, sequences, matrices and data frames.  
* [Practical 2](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical2.html) - plotting with ggplot2, loading CSV files, using dplyr for data frame operations.
    * For this practical you will need to download the   [UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbdavis/DASM/master/data/UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv) to your computer.
* [Practical 3](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical3.html) - Bayes' Theorem, Statistical Distributions.
* [Practical 4](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical4.html) - Hypothesis testing, t-tests, test for equality in variance.
* [Practical 5](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical5.html) - Cross-tabulation, Chi-square test for goodness of fit, Chi-square test of independence, Quantile-Quantile Plots, One-way ANOVA test, Monte Carlo Simulation
* [Practical 6](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical6.html) - Linear fitting, regression diagnostics, reduced major axis regression, multiple regression, replacing values with NA
* [Practical 7](http://cbdavis.github.io/DASM/2017/Practical7.html) - Dates and Times, Time Series Objects, Moving Averages, Lagging Time Values, Auto- and Cross- Covariance and -Correlation Function Estimation, Decomposition, Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess (stl)
