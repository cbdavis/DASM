# What/Why?

[R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).  In more practical terms:

* It's a **digital swiss army knife**
* It's **free** - just download and get started, no license, no trial period
* There's a **huge community** behind it
    * For even the weirdest problems you run into, you can Google it and usually find a solution (probably on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)). 
* You don't have write to code that others have already created (stand on the shoulders of giants)
    * There are over **[9000 contributed packages covering a variety of topics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)**. This means that for a lot of different applications and scientific domains, someone has already created something that you can re-use. This minimizes the amount of work you have to do, while allowing you to do much more sophisticated analysis.
    * **Package management** - you don't have to copy/paste this code. It's managed so that you just have to call the name of the package. You can also have R update every single package that you have installed, in order to get the latest bug fixes, enhancements, etc. 
* It lets you create **repeatable workflows**
    * Have new data? Just run the code again to generate plots + images for reports
* Use of **open source & open standards**
    * Researchers can inspect the source code and report errors to the developers, meaning that the process of finding and fixing bugs in the software is more transparent and efficient.
    * Open standards allow for data portability between a variety of programs, so you're not limited to just using proprietary programs. This can give you greater flexibility in the types of tools you use.

You're already used to programming since **[spreadsheets are code](http://www.slideshare.net/Felienne/spreadsheets-are-code-online)**:

```{Excel}
=SUM(OFFSET($data.$A$1,MATCH($T197,$data.$C$1:$C$1048576,0)-1,MATCH($AL$7&$AL$6,$data.$A$1:$AMJ$1,0)-29,1,2))/1000+SUM(OFFSET($data.$A$1,MATCH($T197,$data.$C$1:$C$1048576,0)-1,RIGHT(V$53,2)*8-7,1,2))/1000-SUM(OFFSET($data.$A$1,MATCH($T197,$data.$C$1:$C$1048576,0)-1,MATCH($AL$7&$AL$6,$data.$A$1:$AMJ$1,0)-37,1,2))/1000
```

This is a formula from an actual spreadsheet in use by a company.  This code is a nightmare to maintain and it's very difficult to check if there are any errors in it.  Spreadsheets create a soup of data storage, processing and presentation (i.e. numbers, formulas and graphs).  This hinders transparency and as spreadsheets get more complex, it becomes very difficult to trace how the data analysis is actually done.  With R, it's possible to use code to read from data files and then **[automatically generate reports in the form of Word documents, pdfs, or html pages](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)**. Separating your data, processing and presentation of results into separate components will help you to stay organized.

# First Steps:

## Setting up R and RStudio

You need to have both R and RStudio set up.  You can use R without RStudio, but if you do, the interface will look like the one on the left image below, and this can be a bit intimidating.  RStudio runs on top of R and provides a more visual interface, in addition to greatly assisting you with various aspects of programming.

</tr>
</table>
</center>

### University Computer
On the university computers you should be able to find RStudio in the Start Menu by looking for `Mathematics & Statistics` -> `R`.  If there are several versions, just pick the one with the highest version number.  **You should not have to install R or RStudio on the university computers.**

### Personal Computer
On your own computer you will have to **install both R and RStudio**

* Download and install R for either [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Mac OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) or [Linux](http://www.jason-french.com/blog/2013/03/11/installing-r-in-linux/)
* [Download and install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Open RStudio

Once you open up RStudio, you'll see that it has four panels, which are:

<table><tr><td>
**Console** - *Bottom Left*

* R commands can be run here
* You can also find documentation for commands by typing in ?commandName to get help, i.e. if you type `?sum` you'll see the documentation for the `sum` function.

**Environment/History** - *Top Right*

* This shows all the variables and functions that are currently loaded in the workspace (the "**Environment**")
* You can click on the variables to see their values, which can be useful to inspect how the code is operating.
* The **History** shows all of the commands that you have run.

**R Script Files** - *Top Left*

* While you can run R code directly in the console, you can also save the code in a script file that allows you to rerun the code at a later date.  
* You can run lines of code by highlighting them, and then clicking on "Run" above.
* You can run all the code at once by doing Code -> Run Region -> Run All

**Files/Plots/Packages/Help** - *Bottom Right*

* **Files** - This shows everything in your current working directory
* **Plots** - Once you start plotting, multiple plots will be stored here.  There are arrows in this view that allow you to navigate  between multiple plots
* **Packages** - Shows all the packages installed and currently loaded
* **Help** - Shows documentation for various functions.

### Install Required Packages

Once R and RStudio is installed, **open up RStudio and install the necessary packages for R**.  Note that with R, the word "package" and "library" are often used interchangeably.  Today we'll need to install the [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) library to do the plotting.


#### Installation Steps

* In the bottom right quadrant of RStudio, locate the `Packages` tab, and click on `Install`:

<center><img src="./images/InstallRPackage.png" style="border:2px solid black"></center>

* Then type in the name of the package `ggplot2`.  You should see it auto-complete as you type:

<center><img src="./images/Install_swirl_type_name.png" style="border:2px solid black"></center>

* Click on `Install` and make sure that `Install dependencies` is checked:

<center><img src="./images/Install_swirl_click_install.png" style="border:2px solid black"></center>

* You should then see statements like this in the console on the bottom left quadrant:

<center><img src="./images/Install_swirl_console.png" style="border:2px solid black"></center>

* As you can see in the console, you can also install packages just by typing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
```

# How to read this tutorial
Everything shown in the large gray boxes below is code that you can run by copy/pasting into the `Console` tab in RStudio. For example:

```{r}
print("hello world")
```

You can also collect these statements in a new R file (`File` -> `New File` -> `R Script`) which you can then run.

If you do create a new R file, you can run the code by selecting one of the options under the `Run` button:
<center><img src="./images/runCodeRStudio.png"></center>

Gray bits of text `like this` usually refer to individual R commands, package names, or the exact name of things that you will see in the user interface.

## Always always always first specify `options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`
Make sure to always run this command when you start using R:
```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

We'll cover what this is in a later practical, but for now it's important to specify the `stringsAsFactors` option whenever running code as you may get confusing results without it.  In short, [R assumes that your data contains factors or categorical variables](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/factors.html), which isn't necessarily the case.

## Assinging values to variables.

We can assign the value of `1` to the variable `a` by doing:
```{r}
a = 1
```

And then can make sure that the value has been assigned:
```{r}
a
```

Instead of using `=`, we can also use `<-` which does the same thing.  You often will see people use both forms of these.
```{r}
a <- 1
```

Although you assigned a number to the variable `a`, you can also assign to it different types of data like text:
```{r}
a = "this is some text"
a
```

## Vectors

```{r}
a  = c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
a
```

Since this is a sequence from 3 to 7, we can also write it like:

```{r}
a  = c(3:7)
a
```

## Matrices

Initialize a matrix of zeros with three columns and two rows.  Then set the value at row 1 and column 2 to `3`
```{r}
b = matrix(0, ncol=3, nrow=2)
b[1,2] = 3
b
```

You can append a matrix to the end of another matrix using `rbind` which means that you will bind the rows together.
```{r}
b = matrix(0, ncol=3, nrow=2)
c = matrix(1, ncol=3, nrow=2)
d = rbind(b,c)
d
```

You can also bind the columns together using `cbind`
```{r}
cbind(b,c)
```

R also has functions that run operations such as `mean` and `sum` on matrix rows and columns:
```{r}
rowMeans(d)
rowSums(d)
colMeans(d)
colSums(d)
```

## Data Frames
Data frames are conceptually similar to matrices, although you can mix in different types of data per column.  In the example below, the first two columns are numbers, while the last column is text.

```{r}
a = data.frame(x = c(1:3),
               y = c(4:6),
               z = c("a", "b", "c"))
a
```

Data frames are similar to matrices in that you can access elements based on their row and column indices.  For example, to get the element in the 2nd row and third column:
```{r}
a[2,3]
```

We can also get just the 2nd row:
```{r}
a[2,]
```

Or just the 3rd column:
```{r}
a[,3]
```

One of the nice things about data frames is that you can use the names of the columns (combined with the `$` sign) to directly access the values in that column.  So if we want to see the values of only the `z` column, we can use `a$z`

```{r}
a$z
```

You can also add a new column to an existing data frame:
```{r}
a$t = c(10, 13, 17)
a
```

We'll look at the `mtcars` data set that is included with R.  If you type `?mtcars` in the console, you'll see more documentation.  Looking at the first few lines of the `mtcars` data frame, we see the following which shows data in several columns: `mpg`, `cyl`, `disp`, `hp`, `drat`, `wt`, `qsec`, `vs`, `am`, `gear` and `carb`
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

The `head` command just shows us the top few rows, and you can also use the `tail` command to look at the bottom rows.

For specific columns, we can use the `mean` and `sd` functions to find the average and standard deviation.
```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
sd(mtcars$mpg)
```

# Reading CSV Files

The following example is based on [CO2 emissions data from the UNFCCC](http://unfccc.int/ghg_data/ghg_data_unfccc/time_series_annex_i/items/3814.php), specifically the ["CO2 excluding LULUCF" Excel spreadsheet](http://unfccc.int/files/ghg_emissions_data/application/x-zip-compressed/ai_co2_wolulucf.zip.zip) which we've transformed into a CSV file.

CSV stands for ["comma-separated values"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) which means that you represent tabular data by using commas to separate values from different columns:

```{csv}
animal,farm_count
chickens,20
cows,10
pigs,5
```

While you can technically read Excel files into R, reading CSV files is much much faster as it is a very simple data format.

Now we'll load in an example data file and create several plots with it.

For this, you'll need the UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv file.  To get it, **right click** on this link: [UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbdavis/DASM/master/2017/data/UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv) and select **"Save Target As"** or **"Save Link As"** to save it to your computer.

Internet Explorer might try to save this as "UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.**txt**", make sure to save this as "UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.**csv**" or adjust your code so that it knows to read the correct file.

One thing you need to check is your working directory. This is the directory where R looks for any files.  You can set this in RStudio `Session` -> `Set Working Directory` -> `Choose Directory`

<center><img src="./images/RStudioSetWorkingDirectory.png" style="border:2px solid black"></center>

Make sure that this is set to the directory where you have placed the `UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv` file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df = read.csv(file="UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df = read.csv(file="./data/UNFCCC_CO2_Emissions.csv")
```

* [How to Transition from Excel to R](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/intro-to-r-for-microsoft-excel-users)
* [R for Excel Users](http://www.rforexcelusers.com/)
* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/index.html)

For a more basic step-by-step introduction, you can install the [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
```

You can then work through tutorials by doing:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(swirl)
swirl()
```

Swirl is interesting since it guides you in learning R, within the R console.  You'll see examples like this:
```{eval=FALSE}
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 +
| 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.
```
