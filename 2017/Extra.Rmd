### Always always always first specify `options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`
Make sure to always run this command when you start using R:
```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

We'll cover what this is in a later practical, but for now it's important to specify the `stringsAsFactors` option whenever running code as you may get confusing results without it.  In short, [R assumes that your data contains factors or categorical variables](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/factors.html), which isn't necessarily the case.

## Cheat sheets

**These sheets are important and summarize much of what you will need to know about R for this course**

* [R Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/r-cheat-sheet.pdf) - this covers many of the basics of using R that you will need to know.
* [Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) - this covers all the types of visualizations that can be done with `ggplot2`
* [Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) - this shows how you can use `dplyr` for reshaping, combining, grouping, and summarizing data frames.  We will cover `dplyr` in a later practical.

## Finding help

In order to find help for how to use an R function, in the console, you can just type `?` followed by the name of the function.  For example, to find out how to use the `sum()` function, just type:

```{r}
?sum
```

You'll note that this will bring up the help page in the bottom right quadrant of RStudio.

If you want to find help for a function that doesn't start with a letter, you have to first surround it with single quotes.  for this example, we want to find information about how to use the `:` operator which allows us to create sequences via commands like `3:7`

```{r}
?':'
```

There is also a search box in the `Help` tab of RStudio, and there are numerous examples online of how to use R commands.

### Exercise
Locate the help pages for `abs` and `%%`

In the `Help` window you should see:

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="./images/HelpPageAbs.png"></td>
<td style="width:100px"></td>
<td><img src="./images/HelpPageModulo.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>

For a more basic step-by-step introduction, you can install the [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
```

You can then work through tutorials by doing:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(swirl)
swirl()
```

Swirl is interesting since it guides you in learning R, within the R console.  You'll see examples like this:
```{eval=FALSE}
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 +
| 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.
```








```{r}
times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval = 0
num_tests = 500
# create a loop where the value of "count" will be 1, 2, 3... num_tests
for (count in c(1:num_tests)){
  
  # sample random values from the distribution
  vals = rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=1)
  
  # calculate mean and standard deviation
  mean_pts = mean(vals)
  sd_pts = sd(vals)
  
  # calculate left and right sides of the 95% confidence interval
  left = mean_pts - (1.96 * sd_pts/sqrt(n))
  right = mean_pts + (1.96 * sd_pts/sqrt(n))
  
  # see if the true_mean is within the bounds of the interval
  if (true_mean >= left & true_mean <= right){
    # if it's in the interval, add one to this variable
    times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval = times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval + 1
  }
}

# show how many times the true_mean falls within the intervals calculated
times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval

# what percentage of the time does the true_mean fall within the intervals calculated?
times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval / num_tests
```

What if we ran this 10,000 times?  How would this percentage change as we repeatedly took more random samples?

Note that the x axis is scaled logarithmically.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval = 0

set.seed(1234)

num_tests = 10000
percent_times_true_mean_in_interval = c()
## create a loop where the value of "count" will be 1, 2, 3... num_tests
for (count in c(1:num_tests)){
  
  # sample random values from the distribution
  vals = rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=1)
  
  # calculate mean and standard deviation
  mean_pts = mean(vals)
  sd_pts = sd(vals)
  
  # calculate left and right sides of the interval
  left = mean_pts - (1.96 * sd_pts/sqrt(n))
  right = mean_pts + (1.96 * sd_pts/sqrt(n))
  
  # see if the true_mean is within the bounds of the interval
  if (true_mean >= left & true_mean <= right){
    # if it's in the interval, add one to this variable
    times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval = times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval + 1
  }
  
  percent_times_true_mean_in_interval = c(percent_times_true_mean_in_interval,
                                          (times_true_mean_in_confidence_interval/count))
}

data = data.frame(percent = percent_times_true_mean_in_interval,
                  iteration = c(1:num_tests))
ggplot(data, aes(x=iteration, y=percent)) + geom_point() + geom_line() +  
  xlab("Iteration") + 
  ylab("Percent times true mean in 95% confidence interval") + scale_x_log10()
```

This shows that there is a lot of variation at first, but as expected, with more samples, we settle into the 95% range.


## Exercises

Try what you have learned above on the examples discussed in the lecture.  Using R, you should arrive at the same numbers that were presented in class.

### Exercise 1

The government says that 26% of the populations smoke.  You want to test this by asking 30 of your friends. 

* If this sample is a good representation of the population, how many do you expect to smoke if the government says the truth?
* Because of the small sample you decide that if 6, 7, 8, or 9 smoke, you believe the government, otherwise you reject – is this a good choice?
* What about trusting the government if 4 – 11 people in the sample smoke

### Exercise 2

A large detector is set up to detect neutrinos. It usually counts 2/day. 

* What is the distribution you would use to estimate the probability of counting x neutrinos in a given day?
* What is the probability of detecting 8/day? Are scientists justified in calling this a special event?
* What if it counts 4/day?


## Power of the test 
You can perform power calculations for t tests via the `power.t.test` function.  If you type `?power.t.test` into the console you should see the following usage documentation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
power.t.test(n = NULL, delta = NULL, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05,
             power = NULL,
             type = c("two.sample", "one.sample", "paired"),
             alternative = c("two.sided", "one.sided"),
             strict = FALSE, tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25)

```
To explain the parameters:

* `delta` parameter is the true difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
* `n` is the sample size
* `sd` is the estimated standard deviation of the population
* `sig.level` is the significance level that you choose, e.g. 0.05, (Type I error probability)
* `power` is the power of test (1 - Type II error probability)
* `alternative` - `two.sided` or `one.sided`
* `type` we will only do this for the `one.sample`

We can now explore the different alternative hypotheses using this function.  Make sure to always fill in the `sig.level` and `sd`.  For `n`, `delta` and `power`, you have to fill in two of them and the test will calculate the remaining one.  If you know sample size (`n`), and the `sig.level`, it will give you the `power` of your test.  If know the `power` you want, then this will give you the sample size to achieve this power.

### Exercise
From previous research we know that the average life span of a certain species of parrot in their native habitat is 28.0 years, with a standard deviation of 5 years.  
 
A researcher studies a sample of 20 parrots in a new habitat. Assuming the standard deviation does not change, what is the chance that we can detect an increase in lifetime of 2 years compared to the old habitat at the 95% confidence level? 

On your own, explore different hypotheses where the alternative mean is from 29 to 33, then plot the power of the test as a function as each alternative hypothesis.

You should see:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x0 = 28
xa = seq(28.5, 33, by = 0.5)
n = 20

sigma = 5
alpha = 0.05

# calculate difference between the means
diff = xa - x0

delta = abs(x0-xa)/sigma*sqrt(n)

res = power.t.test(delta = diff, sd = sigma, sig.level = alpha, n = n, 
                   type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")

beta1 = 1 - res$power

# create a data frame showing for different values of xa the power of the t test
df = data.frame(xa, power = res$power)

ggplot(df, aes(x=xa, y=power)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("n = 20")

```

Now, assuming that mu_a is 30, we can show the power as a function of sample size:

```{r}
xa = 30
diff = xa - x0
n = c(2:100)
res = power.t.test(delta = diff, sd = sigma, sig.level = alpha, n = n, 
                   type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")

beta1 = 1 - res$power

# create a data frame showing for different values of xa the power of the t test
df = data.frame(n, power = res$power)

ggplot(df, aes(x=n, y=power)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Power vs. Sample Size")

```


### Exercise
Now assuming a power of 0.9 and mu_a = 30, then find the sample size to achieve this power of the test.

You should get:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
xa = 30
diff = xa - x0
power = 0.9
n = 20
res = power.t.test(delta = diff, sd = sigma, sig.level = alpha, power=power, 
                   type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")
res
```





#### Exercise 1

Download the [Pr_20May1.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbdavis/DASM/master/data/Pr_20May1.csv) to your computer in the same way that you did for the other csv file in this practical.

This data contains a time series of monthly temperature data from Jan. 1946 to Dec. 2014, however the data set you just downloaded only has a single column with the temperatures and does not have a column included which corresponds to these dates.  

Fix this by making a vector with the dates corresponding to each data point, and make a plot of the temperatures over time.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pr = read.csv("./data/Pr_20May1.csv")
t = seq(from = as.Date("1946-01-01"), to = as.Date("2014-12-01"), by="1 month")
pr$t = t
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(pr, aes(x=t, y=x)) + geom_line()
```

**TODO** most (all) of content below is duplicated

`POSIXct` does more or less the same as `Date`, but it stores the time variable as numbers of seconds since midnight GMT 1970-01-01.  As a result, this allows us to store data which expresses the time on a specific date.

```{r}
t.str = "2013-12-19 10:17:07"    # default format
t.obj = as.POSIXct(t.str) 
t.obj
```

If you have any other format than default format e.g., if you need to read in data that are not in the default format, then you can give R the format the data are in:

```{r}
t.str1 = "19-12-2013 10:17:07"
t.obj1 = as.POSIXct(t.str1, format="%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")
t.obj1
```

`"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S"` says that we have a time that is specified in the form of day, month and year (separated by `-`) which is then followed by a space and the hours, minutes and seconds (separated by `:`).

```{r}
t.obj1
format(t.obj1, "%a %d %b. %Y")
```

### Adding and subtracting dates
You can add and subtract POSIXt objects and perform logical operations on them. If you have a vector of POSIXt objects, you can use the `min()`, `max()` and `range()` functions. 

```{r}
t.str2 = "2013-12-19 18:20:07"
t.obj2 = as.POSIXct(t.str2)
```

Subtract two date times:
```{r}
t.obj1 - t.obj2
```




##### Exercise 2

**TODO** find a home for this in the date exercise

Using the same `Carbon.csv` data set:

* Make time vector of the date (the `date_start` column).  If you type `class(input1$date_start)` you'll see that it's currently represented as a factor.
* Make a new vector that formats the date, so that it just shows the month (see examples above).  You may also have to use `as.Date()` to convert the `date_start` values from a factor to a Date object.

If you do this correctly, you should see:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
months = format(as.Date(input1$date_start), "%B")
months
```

We can now add this vector directly to the data frame:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
input1$months = months
```
