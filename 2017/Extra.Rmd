### Always always always first specify `options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`
Make sure to always run this command when you start using R:
```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

We'll cover what this is in a later practical, but for now it's important to specify the `stringsAsFactors` option whenever running code as you may get confusing results without it.  In short, [R assumes that your data contains factors or categorical variables](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/factors.html), which isn't necessarily the case.
